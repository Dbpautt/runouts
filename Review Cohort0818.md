### Bugs

When We tried to join a different group we didn't create it threw and error:

TypeError: Cannot read property 'username' of null
    at Group.find.populate.then.group (/Users/dbp/IronHack Bootcamp/code/exercises/runouts/routes/groups.js:87:36)
    at process._tickCallback (internal/process/next_tick.js:68:7)




## Git History

Include better details of the commits to make more clear about changes on the code.
On this particualr project the commits have not a lot to do with the code, for example a commit related to handle errors was on app.js require express but no changes on errors it was just a delete and add line.


## code quality

- consistency
    very consistent +1
- formatting
 comments on routes specially groups.js are helpful +1
- best practices
    no 'use strict'

- simplicity
    maybe in the errors instead of catching then calling next could catch(next)

- DRY
    Don't repeat themselves only tiy recomendation was with the catch.
- validation

- authorization
    You can go to log in again even tho you're already logged in.
    Same with signup
- semantic html
    Identation!
    Too many classes that don't explain what the class do
    Could have invluded other types of tags as ul , li, sections
    too many Ids and classes
- clean css 
    we are not familiar with bootstrap =( no comments

## product quality

- usability
    It does the user stories
    Sometimes when you register there's not a lot of feedback for the user.
    For example when you are on your profile it's not clear what the + botton does
    
    
- design
    It's coherent with the wireframe and on the application
    should have a tiny of design on the errors pages

- responsiveness
    it's not designed for desktop
    it's a mobile app
- finished look
    +1 consistant in colours style, most of the elements of the app were styled.
